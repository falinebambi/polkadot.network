It's time to <a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/YTbZzCkRQCEJa" target="_blank">celebrate</a>, today is Siteleaf's first birthday!

Here's what we've been up to lately:

- [GitHub Pages integration](/blog/github-pages/): now you can publish your site with version control, see revisions and revert back to any publish state.
- [New help site](http://v1.siteleaf.com/help/): we have a new site for theme documentation, tips, and FAQs (built on Siteleaf of course).
- [User roles](/blog/introducing-user-roles/): control site access for your collaborators and&nbsp;clients.
- [Asset metadata](/blog/new-asset-meta-and-quick-post-edit): add captions, alt text, and information to your images.
- [Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/zapbook/siteleaf/): create new Siteleaf posts via e-mail or third party services.
- [Siteleaf Gallery](/gallery): see how others are using Siteleaf and get inspiration.

If you're just joining us, we now have free [Developer accounts](/blog/developer-accounts/) available. You can sign up for free, try out our [tutorials](/blog/tags/tutorial/), and get a feel for the service before going live.
