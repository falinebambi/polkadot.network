We're happy to be included by GitHub in the official [GitHub Integrations Directory](https://github.com/integrations/siteleaf). 

Connect your website repo with Siteleaf and your Markdown content is editable in a friendly CMS designed with non-technical writers and clients in mind. Build sites using the tools you love, and make it easy to others to contribute without having to write code or understand Git.

Visit the [Siteleaf integration](https://github.com/integrations/siteleaf) and start using Siteleaf as a CMS for your Jekyll and GitHub Pages sites today.
