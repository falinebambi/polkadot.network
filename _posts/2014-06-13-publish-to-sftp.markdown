Siteleaf now supports publishing to SFTP! 

Also known as Secure or [SSH File Transfer Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol), SFTP joins our extensive publishing options including FTP, Amazon S3, Rackspace Cloud Files, [GitHub Pages](/blog/github-pages) and our free Siteleaf Hosting.

When publishing to SFTP your files are encrypted and transferred over a secure channel to your server.

In addition to regular FTP, this protocol is supported on most popular hosts including [Media Temple](http://mediatemple.net), [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com), [1&1](http://www.1and1.com), and [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com).
