Hello Brooklyn! This week the Siteleaf team will be at our favorite web conference, [Brooklyn Beta](http://brooklynbeta.org).

We've been huge fans and supporters of Brooklyn Beta over the years, and a proud sponsor of the very [first conference](https://brooklynbeta.org/2010) (even before Siteleaf launched!).

This year our team be hosting two Siteleaf hackdays, right downstairs from the conference at [The Invisible Dog](http://theinvisibledog.org/):
- [Wednesday October 9, 2:30-6pm](http://siteleaf2.eventbrite.com)
- [Thursday October 10, 2:30-6pm](http://siteleaf.eventbrite.com) (sold out)

If you're in town for the conference, [RSVP](http://siteleaf2.eventbrite.com) and spend an afternoon with us! Or drop in for a quick demo and Q&A, we'd love to see you.

"Make Something You Love" is the official mantra of Brooklyn Beta, and something our team lives by. Siteleaf was made out of love, and we hope using it helps you **make something you love**.
