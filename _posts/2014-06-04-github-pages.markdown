Exciting news! Starting today you can now publish your sites from Siteleaf to [GitHub&nbsp;Pages](https://pages.github.com).

GitHub Pages is a solid choice for static web hosting, especially if you already use [GitHub](http://github.com) to manage your theme code—and it's clear a lot of our users [already do](https://github.com/siteleaf/siteleaf-themes/wiki/Siteleaf-themes-on-Github).

### Why GitHub Pages?
- **It's fast!** Check out this comparison by [Jeremy Morgan](http://www.jeremymorgan.com/blog/programming/how-fast-are-github-pages/).
- **It's powered by a global CDN**, from the folks at [Fastly](http://www.fastly.com/customers/github/).
- **It's version controlled!** Every publish is a commit, so you can see revisions and revert back to any publish state.
- **And there's no extra cost**, GitHub Pages is included with your GitHub account.

Siteleaf will publish your site to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository (private or public), and even create the required `CNAME` file for GitHub. For full details, visit our [GitHub Pages help page](http://v1.siteleaf.com/help/hosting/github).

We've been quietly testing this feature out over the past couple weeks, and we're excited to make it available to all users right now. 

GitHub Pages joins our existing publishing options—FTP, Amazon S3, Rackspace Cloud Files, and our free Siteleaf Hosting—giving you more flexibility and reaffirming our commitment that your data belongs to you. Enjoy!
