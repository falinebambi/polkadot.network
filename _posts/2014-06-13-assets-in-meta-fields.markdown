Siteleaf makes it easy to assign assets in your metadata fields, just drag and drop (as shown above).

Now in your theme, you can easily link to your asset:

```liquid
{% raw %}<a href="{{ meta['project_link'] }}">
  {{ meta['project_link_title'] }}
</a>{% endraw %}
```

This is a great way to reference special assets like featured images or PDF downloads.

To learn more about metadata see our tutorial [Metadata in Siteleaf](/blog/metadata-in-siteleaf).
