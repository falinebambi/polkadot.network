Last week we released the brand new [Siteleaf v2](/blog/v2), which is built on Jekyll and comes with tons of [new features](/features) like GitHub sync.

To help get everyone up to speed on v2, we're excited to officially launch our new help site [learn.siteleaf.com](http://learn.siteleaf.com).

Learn about [Developing Themes](http://learn.siteleaf.com/themes/), [Managing Content](http://learn.siteleaf.com/content/), using the [API](http://learn.siteleaf.com/api/), how to migrate your [Legacy Site](http://learn.siteleaf.com/v1/), and more!

The help site itself is built on Siteleaf v2 (of course), and is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/siteleaf/learn.siteleaf.com). We encourage your feedback and contributions.

**Pro tip:** You can even download a full copy of the repo ([ZIP](https://github.com/siteleaf/learn.siteleaf.com/archive/master.zip)) for offline reference.

Happy learning!
