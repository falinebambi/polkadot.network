Today, we’re announcing developer accounts. At launch, we required a subscription in order to use Siteleaf, unless you were invited to a site. Now, you can sign up for free, test the waters, and get a feel for the service before subscribing. If you want to publish your site, simply upgrade to one of our [plans](/plans) and publish away.

Alongside developer accounts, we’re introducing the ability to transfer ownership of sites. Instead of using up your site limit with client websites, transfer ownership of the sites to their account. This way, your clients can pay for their account directly and you can make space for that side project you actually want to work on.

If you’re new to Siteleaf, [try out a developer account](https://manage.siteleaf.com/signup?plan=developer) today and, as always, feel free to reach out to us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/siteleaf) or by [email](mailto:team@siteleaf.com) if you need a hand.
