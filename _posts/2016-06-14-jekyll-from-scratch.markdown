This tutorial was created using Jekyll version 3.1.6. Newer versions (3.2+) will give you a theme by default instead of `_layouts` and `_includes`. For the purpose of this tutorial you may want to downgrade to Jekyll 3.1.6 (to remove other versions, run `gem uninstall jekyll`). Stay tuned for a future tutorial on themes!
{: .warning}

In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to get set up and develop websites locally using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). We'll cover installation, creating a new site, file structure, and finally we'll commit the new site to GitHub.

This will give you a functional website that you can edit offline. Also make sure to check out the [next tutorial](/blog/connecting-github) where we'll connect our site to the new [Siteleaf v2](/blog/v2) so we can edit content in the cloud.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static website generator built on Ruby. It takes [Markdown text](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (your site's content) and [Liquid templates](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) (your site's theme) and outputs simple HTML that can be hosted pretty much anywhere. 

It's also what powers [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which serves more than [half a million websites](https://github.com/blog/1992-eight-lessons-learned-hacking-on-github-pages-for-six-months).

## Getting started

To get started, we are going to install Jekyll, which is available to download as a Ruby gem. We’ll be following the quick-start instructions on [Jekyll’s website](http://jekyllrb.com). 

So let’s open the trusty command line.

First, you’ll want to make sure you are running a recent version of Ruby. You can confirm by running the following command:

```bash
$ ruby -v
```

The [latest stable](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) version is 2.3.1, but anything above 2.2 should be fine. If you need to upgrade, we recommend using something like [rbenv](http://rbenv.org) to make it easy.


So now to install Jekyll, we’ll run:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll -v 3.1.6
```

## Creating a site

Now that we have Jekyll installed, we can create a new site by running:

```bash
$ jekyll new my-site
```

Feel free to replace `my-site` with whatever you’d like to call your site.

Jekyll will automatically create a folder for the new site, so let’s change directory:

```bash
$ cd my-site
```

Jekyll will give you its default theme which is a great way to see how it works. So open this folder in your favorite text editor and let’s have a quick peek at its file structure.

## Jekyll file structure

### Site config

The first file we’ll look at, and probably the most important, is `_config.yml`. This file contains all your site settings, including `title`, `description`, `url`, and any other metadata you’d like to include in [YAML format](http://yaml.org).

It should look something like this:

```yaml
# Site settings
title: Your awesome title
email: your-email@domain.com
description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
  line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://yourdomain.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
twitter_username: jekyllrb
github_username:  jekyll
```

These settings can be referenced in Liquid using the `site` prefix, for example: {% raw %}`{{site.email}}`{% endraw %}
{: .tip}

You can refer to [Jekyll’s excellent documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) for a full list of configuration settings.

### Templates & partials

You should see a pair of special folders called `_includes` and `_layouts`, this is where your Liquid files will go. 

Includes are great for small bits of [reusable code](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#includes), and Layouts define how a page will render.

### Collections & documents

One of Jekyll’s most exciting features is [Collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), which is essentially a folder of text files (called Documents). Collection folders always start with underscore, and by default you’ll see a collection called `_posts` which is designed to behave like a blog. 

Inside the `_posts` folder, you should see a sample post called “Welcome to Jekyll,” containing some Markdown-formatted text.

Posts are special, and are named using the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.markdown`.

As another important distinction, all documents and pages start with a block of YAML called [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/). This is what separates static files from those that are processed by Jekyll. Similar to the config file, front matter contains your document title, date, and other metadata. You can also use front matter to reference the layout you’d like to use.

Your default post should look something like this:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title:  "Welcome to Jekyll!"
date:   2016-06-11 18:20:24 -0400
categories: jekyll update
---
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory...
```

### Output

Another special folder you’ll come across later is `_site`. This is where Jekyll stores its compiled HTML files. Once built, these files can be uploaded directly to an FTP server for hosting.

If using Git, you’ll generally want to use a [`.gitignore` file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) to avoid checking in the compiled `_site` folder.
{: .tip}

That’s just a quick overview of the file structure, for a more in-depth look see: <http://learn.siteleaf.com/themes/structure/>

## Local preview

Now that we’ve looked under the hood, let’s preview our Jekyll site:

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

By default Jekyll will serve on localhost port 4000. We can open this up in a web browser, and take a look at the default theme and content.

{: .caption}

It’s nothing fancy, but you should see a “Welcome to Jekyll” post and an “About” page. 

Next we can try making a small change. 

Find the about page in the site’s root, called `about.md`. This file could also be called `about.markdown` if that’s your preference, either extension is fine. 

So make a quick text change, and hit save in your text editor.

Now, refresh the browser and the text change should be immediately available.

Jekyll is working behind the scenes to automatically detect changes in the site’s files, so you don’t have to restart your server when making edits. The only exception to this is the `_config.yml` file.

## Push to GitHub

Now that we’ve created a basic Jekyll site, we could grab the contents of `_site` and upload it just as it is to an FTP server.

But for this tutorial, we’ll take it a step further and push the site to GitHub so we can connect it with Siteleaf later.

In the video above, I'm using the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) app, but you can use your favorite Git tool here. 

Below is how we can do the same from the command line.

First, we’ll initialize the local repository:

```bash
$ git init
```

Next, we’ll stage the files and commit changes:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
```

Finally, we’ll add our remote GitHub repo and push to master:

```bash
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-site.git
$ git push origin master
```

And that’s it, you should now have a working Jekyll site on GitHub.
