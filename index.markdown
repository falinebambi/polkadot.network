  subtitle: Polkadot is a blockchain technology. a heterogeneous multi-chain.
  body: It consists of many parachains with potentially differing characteristics, such as ability to provide anonymity or formal verification. Transactions can be spread out across the chains, allowing many more to be processed in the same period of time. Polkadot ensures that each of these blockchains remains secure and that any dealings between the are faithfully executed. Specialised parachains called bridges can be created to link independent chains.

      A truly decentralised (“server-less”) and inclusive vision of the Internet society, facilitating privacy and resistance in the face of censorship and oppression. Services being built with multiple communicating blockchains, sharing information via smart contracts, not held back by the limits of individual chain scalability.

  body: |-
    Polkadot is a protocol that allows independent blockchains to exchange information. Polkadot is an inter-chain blockchain protocol which unlike internet messaging protocols (e.g. TCP/IP) also enforces the order and the validity of the messages between the chains. This inter-operability also allows the additional benefit of scalability by creating a general environment for multiple state machines.

      The Polkadot network will use DOT tokens as a measure of stake within the network, requiring them to take part in the governance and direction of the overall system as well as payment for certain kinds of operations within the system such as the bonding of commercial chains.

      Tokens purchased during this sale will not exist until the genesis block launch, currently estimated to happen in Q3 2019.

  - body: |-
      The sale will be a "spend-all second-price Dutch auction" where a fixed amount representing 50% of the total genesis block allocation of tokens will be sold. We will certainly accept Ether in the sale; other crypto-currencies may also be accepted depending on technical feasibility and timeline.

      We are targeting mid-August for the start of the sale; we intend to issue a 14-day countdown once we have the specific date nailed down.

      As a form of Dutch auction, the token price (and therefore "cap") starts high and decreases over time until all tokens are sold. The timetable of how fast the price reduces is predefined, starting fast and getting slower over time. The final details, including identity requirements and auction timetable will be published along with the specific date that the sale will begin in the near future.

      Pursuant to certain identity requirements forced on us by international regulations, we are happy to allow citizens and organisations of almost all jurisdictions globally the opportunity to participate in this event (we are sad to note that due to legal restrictions, we are unable to accept the contributions of citizens of Japan). We will endeavour to make the certification as  cheap, swift and convenient as possible.
